Decision Tree Classifier, XGBClassifier, Random Forest Classifier all the algorithms would perform best.
Decision Tree Classifier was giving an accuracy of 71%
Random Forest Classifier was giving an accuracy of 73%
XGBClassifier was giving an accuracy of 85%

I have increased the accuracy to 87% of XGBClassifier by tuning the hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV
